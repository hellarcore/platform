## What is a contract 

Contracts are registered sets of rules defined in a [JSON Application Schema](../../getting-started/core-concepts#app-schema-and-contracts).

See the Hellar Platform documentation for more information about [Data Contracts](https://hellarplatform.readme.io/docs/explanation-platform-protocol-data-contract).
