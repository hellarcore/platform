### About Wallet-lib 

When Hellar.Client is initiated with a `mnemonic` property, a wallet instance becomes accessible via `client.wallet` property.

To initialize the wallet account and synchronize with the network, use `client.wallet.getAccount()`.

Find out more about the Wallet in its [complete documentation](https://hellarpay.github.io/platform/Wallet-library/)
