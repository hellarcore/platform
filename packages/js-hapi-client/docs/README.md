Client library used to access Hellar HAPI endpoints

This library enables HTTP-based interaction with the Hellar blockchain and Hellar
Platform via the decentralized API ([HAPI](https://github.com/hellarpro/hapi))
hosted on Hellar masternodes.

 - `HAPI-Client` provides automatic server (masternode) discovery using either a default seed node or a user-supplied one
 - `HAPI-Client` maps to HAPI's [RPC](https://github.com/hellarpro/hapi/tree/master/lib/rpcServer/commands) and [gRPC](https://github.com/hellarpro/hapi/tree/master/lib/grpcServer/handlers) endpoints
